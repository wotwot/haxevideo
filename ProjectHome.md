HaxeVideo is an multithread FLV streaming server entirely written using the Haxe programming language. The source code is very small and the server is lightweight (both CPU and memory) but very scalable.

FLV is the format used by Flash. HaxeVideo support FLV video streaming, Webcam/Microphone recording and Live streaming (for chat/web conferences).

Please note that HaxeVideo is an experimental server : it is not actively supported or developped, and not production-ready. It is however a very small and extensible codebase to start building your own RTMP server.
